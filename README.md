## Tech Stack
- [A-Frame.js](https://aframe.io/) - This application was developed using A-Frame.js, an open-source framework for building web-based VR experiences.
- ReactJS - Leveraging the ReactJS framework enabled efficient app development. It played a pivotal role in calculations, data structure management, and adopting modern syntax.
- JavaScript - The core functionalities relied heavily on JavaScript for execution.

The **[Highbridge](https://hessvacio.com/pages/ChristmasInOvenland/index.html)** is driven by a config.json file that holds all necessary properties for the experience. The application reads from this file, interprets the data, and subsequently delivers the experience. This approach was chosen to keep the application both simple and comprehensible. While the creation and debugging of the config.json were labor-intensive, the outcome is genuinely rewarding.

MadeInBrooklynGames took on this project without prior experience in A-Frame.js. However, their dedication and perseverance have paid off, resulting in this fantastic VR experience.
